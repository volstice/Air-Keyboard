# Air-Keyboard

## Objective
This project uses OpenCV to map hand finger coordinates to actually type into an AR Keyboard.

## About the Project
The project uses computer vision and hand gesture recognition systems to make typing on a computer easier and more efficient. It is based on the OpenCV library and uses a web camera to capture the user's gestures and convert them into text or commands. The user can then type on the virtual keyboard with their hands, allowing for a more natural typing experience.
